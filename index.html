<h1>Elixir 1.0.5 and rebar issue</h1>


<p>
I started to encounter the following error 'Could not find rebar, which is needed to build dependency :idnaâ€™ on linux after recent upgrade to Elixir 1.0.5 from 1.0.4.

Upon search and checking forums, I was able to solve it by manually install rebar.

</p><p>
apt-get -y install rebar

</p>
<p>
should solve the issue
